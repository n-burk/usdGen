# gateIncludeDriver.cmake
# Test driver for the B-1 include gate (cmake/CheckNoStageInclude.cmake).
# Runs the gate against a fixture tree and verifies the gate's verdict
# matches the expectation, so the gate is proven to fail on forbidden
# input and pass on clean input (no silent false passes either way).
#
# Inputs (via -D):
#   FIXTURE_DIR - root of the fixture tree (must mirror libs/usdGenMath,
#                 libs/usdGen, testutils/usdGenTestUtils)
#   FORBIDDEN   - the same forbidden-include regex the real gate uses
#   EXPECT      - "fail" (gate must FATAL_ERROR) or "pass" (gate must pass)
