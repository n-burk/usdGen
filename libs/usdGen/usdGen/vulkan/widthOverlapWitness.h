// Test-only overlap probe ABI. Vulkan port of the gpu/widthOverlapWitness.h
// contract: one thread records simultaneous probes and waits for the
// expected arrivals, but only until a caller-bounded deadline so a serial
// queue cannot deadlock. The CUDA kernel takes its bound in device clocks;
// this module takes it as a spin-iteration budget (see widthOverlapWitness
// .comp), which keeps the probe portable across Vulkan devices.
