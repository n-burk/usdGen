// workerPool.h — a persistent fork/join pool for the scheduler's parallel
// regions.
//
// TBB's arena pays ~0.2ms per region on this machine (wakeup stagger plus
// the calling thread's lottery: the master joins the arena, so a master
// parked on a slow core drags the span). The pool instead keeps one worker
// per fast CPU parked on a generation counter: dispatch is one
// release-store plus a wake, the master coordinates without computing, and
// small claimed chunks keep a stacked or slow worker from setting the
// wall the way a static split would. Workers spin generously (bench and
// frame gaps never sleep) and then block on a condition variable, so a
// truly idle pool costs no power while hot loops never touch the wake
// path.
//
// Semantics mirror UsdGenWorkDispatcher::ParallelFor: body(0..count-1),
// joined before return, any partition (callers must be partition-agnostic,
// as they already are for TBB). The first worker exception is rethrown on
// the caller after every worker finished its chunk (TBB would cancel
// pending siblings instead; no body throws today outside OOM).
//
// One pool per owner (a scheduler, a Vulkan pipeline): concurrent
// ParallelFor on the same pool from two threads is not supported, exactly
// like concurrent use of one TBB arena from two masters is not attempted.
// Bodies must not re-enter the pool (no nested ParallelFor); nothing does.
