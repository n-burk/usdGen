// usdGen imaging — session key + session + process-global session store
// (06-imaging.md §3.7; ADR §4.5 "sessions across chains").
//
// Stage-free key (plan 13 §7): a nonempty usdGen:sessionId explicitly
// shares a CPU groom session across renderer chains. Device/GL publication
// sets rendererLocal, retaining the renderer instance in the key because its
// CUDA/GL resources cannot be shared across registries. Without an id, every
// groom is scoped to its render instance. No stage registry is consulted.
//
// The store holds the session alive (strong refs); scene indices hold weak
// handles and re-attach on construction (S15). A renderer switch therefore
// re-attaches to the same session and continues its generation counter.
