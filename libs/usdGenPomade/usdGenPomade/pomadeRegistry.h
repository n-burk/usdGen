// usdGenPomade — the process-global model registry (plan/18 §2.1).
//
// Before V0 there were two unrelated models: the one Pomade_Create allocated
// inside the DLL for the tools, and the one UsdGenPomadeSceneIndex allocated
// for itself. Nothing joined them, so every edit the tools made was invisible
// in the viewport (plan/18 §0 F1). The registry is that join:
//
//   * Pomade_Create registers its model and gets a model id back;
//     Pomade_Destroy unregisters it.
//   * every scene index attaches on construction and detaches on
//     destruction, as a PomadePublishTarget;
//   * Pomade_Activate names the one model the viewport draws;
//   * Pomade_Publish (main thread) hands the active model to every attached
//     target, which is the ONLY way the viewport learns about a change.
//
// The registry deliberately knows nothing about Hydra: the publish target is
// an interface so this header stays free of pxr includes and the C ABI can
// include it without pulling in the imaging stack.
