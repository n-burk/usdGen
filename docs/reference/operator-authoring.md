# Authoring an operator stack

An `UsdGenDescription` binds a surface and owns one `Ops` scope. Place operator
prims beneath that scope. The composed hierarchy supplies the execution order:
children run before parents, and lower siblings run before upper siblings. The
first sibling is the terminal result that usdGen publishes. The small
[`Scatter → Grow` scene](../../examples/scatter-grow-plane.usda) authors
`Grow` above `Scatter` for this reason. There is no authored
`usdGen:input` wire for an ordinary stack.

Most stacks begin with `Scatter` followed by `Grow` or `GuideInterpolate`.
`CurveSource` and `ReferenceSource` can begin with authored curves instead.
Modifiers then refine shape, width, and movement. A source that is disabled
produces an empty curve set; a disabled modifier passes its upstream curves
through. On schema-authored operators, `usdGen:enabled` defaults to `true`.

On schema-authored operators, `usdGen:seed` defaults to `0`. Random draws use stable curve
IDs, so keeping the seed and IDs fixed makes random variation repeatable.
Stylers and deformers inherit `usdGen:mask`, a weight from 0 to 1 that
defaults to 1. A mask of zero preserves the upstream result; a value between
zero and one blends the effect. Put an authored number on the attribute for
uniform strength, or connect a typed `UsdGenExpression` result to vary it
across roots or CVs. Evaluation metadata determines whether an expression
runs once for the groom, each strand, or each CV. The
[`expression-width-plane` scene](../../examples/expression-width-plane.usda)
shows a connected width and frizz mask. `UsdGenExprOp` is different: it
evaluates a program as a geometry or width operation in the stack.

Schema defaults describe attributes, not guaranteed visible results. For
example, `Collide` has `usdGen:pushAmount = 0`, so its default correction is
zero, and `Wind` starts with zero strengths. A relationship needs a valid
target before its related effect can appear. The reference pages call out
declared options that the current kernel refuses, such as vector Displace.
`UsdGenInstance` is declared in the schema but has no registered kernel.
`UsdGenWidthBlend` has a runtime kernel but no generated USD schema type.

The CPU example scenes render through stock Storm. Some operators are on the
CPU reference lane only; CUDA admission rejects those types. A groom whose
`UsdGenGroom` prim selects CUDA may cook device curves, but the stock Storm
device-resident handoff is not available. For an interactive display example,
start with the plain `Xform` groom parent in
[`scatter-grow-plane.usda`](../../examples/scatter-grow-plane.usda) and the
[examples guide](../../examples/README.md).

Pomade's viewport Scale gizmo calls its helper `scaleFactor`; that is an
authoring gesture for scaling selected tube parts. It is not a `UsdGenScale`
operator attribute. The operator's authored scalar is `usdGen:scale`. See
[Pomade](../pomade-tool.md) for the tool and its commit workflow.
